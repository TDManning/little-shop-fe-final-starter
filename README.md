# Little Shop - Coupon Codes | Final Project | Frontend Starter Repo

This Vite Little Shop - Coupon Codes FE Final Project Boilerplate is built to consume and display the data from the BE Rails API built in the Mod 2 Final Project.  

## Set Up Instructions

**Note:** Do **not** clone this repo into your backend repo. Put it somewhere else as a stand alone. The BE and FE repos will remain two separate repos and you will submit the links to each.  

1. Fork repo
1. Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>`
1. `cd` into cloned repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start developing.
  1. You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"

## Notes

This FE application is build to consume the data from your Rails API.  In order for it to work, you must have your Rails API running on localhost:3000. You will see fetch errors when running the FE without the BE API up and running.
